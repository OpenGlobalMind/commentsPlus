## I attended the Future of Text symposium 2020 :joe:
## Gyuri was there which was interesting because we'd just been corresponding on the OGM Discourse forum
## Discourse seems a bit deficient in terms of it's ability to support meta-meta discussions (which Pete had been talking about in the mailing list before I left)
