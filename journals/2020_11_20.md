## I attended the Future of Text symposium 2020 :joe:
## Gyuri was there which was interesting because we'd just been corresponding on the OGM Discourse forum
## Discourse seems a bit deficient in terms of it's ability to support meta-meta discussions (which Pete had been talking about in the mailing list before I left)
## It's not clear that people are totally excited about Logseq, but I have found it a bit fun.
## Slightly unclear why I had to re-add it here, but that wasn't hard to do. Maybe at some point I should read the docs.
