title: Nov 18th, 2020

## Hey, this thing ate a bunch of stuff I wrote... that's not good.  I wonder if it's because we are using mixed Markdown and Org mode formats. :joe:
## Mixed Markdown and Org mode formats should be OK, no? (It's all just ASCII text)
### Yes, in principle it *should* be fine, I guess.
## I wonder what happens if I just dump some Obsidian generated files into this repo - let's see ....
## Later on 18 Nov: some noticings.
### the metadata when listing pages shows this as modified (created?) on 17 Nov with the title of "Nov 18th, 2020".
### a markdown file with a "title:" element at the top is listed with that title.
### listing "all files" seems to show files that have been deleted. which raises the question: how are items deleted using the web interface?
### I keep comparing my experience of this web interface with that of Obsidian (which seems easier to build a model for). What am I assuming or missing here?
