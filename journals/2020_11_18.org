** It's not clear why this didn't show up today directly. I did find a work-around for that. Maybe the problem is that we have a mix of `.md` and `.org` format files. Possibly this can be resolved by everyone setting Avi→Settings→Preferred file format the same way. Presently mine is set to "Org" but if people hate that we could use Markdown
