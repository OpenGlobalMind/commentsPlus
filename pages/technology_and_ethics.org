#+TITLE: technology and ethics

** A recent essay by Stephen Batchelor brings in some thinking from Heidegger: https://tricycle.org/magazine/stephen-batchelor-climate/
** I would be interested to juxtapose this with thinking from Gilbert Simondon: http://blogs.bbk.ac.uk/artsresearch/files/2016/09/gilbert-simondon-technical-mentality.pdf
*** I presently am organizing a paper about "Human Computer Co-Creativity and Ethics", which might be of interest to some here.  A little bit of diagramming is going on in Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lepnGOc=/
